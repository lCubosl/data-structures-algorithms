# Your task is to computer the length distribution of the distinct substrings of a given string.

# For example, the distinct substrings of the string abab are a, b, ab, ba, aba, bab and abab. Their length 
# distribution is as follows:

# length 1: substring count 2
# length 2: substring count 2
# length 3: substring count 2
# length 4: substring count 1

# In a file distribution.py, implement the function create_distribution that returns the distinct substring length 
# distribution for the string given as a parameter. The distribution must be returned as a dictionary as shown in the 
# examples.

# The function will be tested in various situations, where the string is of length at most 20 and consists of the 
# characters a–z. The function should be efficient in all such situations.

def create_distribution(string):
  substrings = set()
  distribution = {}

  for i in range(len(string)):
    for j in range(i, len(string)):
      substrings.add(string[i:j+1])
  

  for substring in substrings:
    length = len(substring)
    if length in distribution:
      distribution[length] +=1
    else:
      distribution[length] =1

  return distribution

print(create_distribution("aaaa"))  # {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
print(create_distribution("abab"))  # {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1}
print(create_distribution("abcd"))  # {1: 4, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 1}
print(create_distribution("abbbbbb")) # {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1}
print(create_distribution("aybabtu")) # {1: 5, 2: 6, 3: 5, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 1}
