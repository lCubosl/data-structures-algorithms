# A gummy candy costs a euros and a chocolate candy costs b euros. What is the maximum number of candies you can buy if you have c euros?
# You may assume that a, b and c are integers in the range 1 ... 100.
# In a file candies.py, implement the function count that returns the maximum number of candies.

def count(a, b, c):
  candies = 0
  candy_of_choice = min(a, b)
  # print(candy_of_choice)

  # >= ensures the last 3 lines of code donÂ´t need to be written
  while c >= candy_of_choice:
    candies += 1
    c -= candy_of_choice

    # c is the same value of candy_of_choice then c turns to 0 and adds 1 to candies
    # if c == candy_of_choice:
    #   candies += 1
    #   c = 0

  return candies

print(count(3, 4, 11)) # 3
print(count(5, 1, 100)) # 100
print(count(2, 3, 1)) # 0
print(count(2, 3, 9)) # 4

# Explanation: In the first test, a gummy candy costs 3 euros and a chocolate candy costs 4 euros. You can buy at most 3 candies with 11 euros. 
# For example, two gummy candies and one chocolate candy cost a total of 10 euros leaving you with 1 euro.
