# Your task is to design a rule set for the robot of the previous task. The goal is to find out if the 
# input string consists of two copies of the same string back to back.

# For example, the robot should accept the following input strings:
# 00
# 001001
# 10111011

# The robot should reject the following example inputs:
# 01
# 00100
# 10111101

# You may assume that the length of the input string is 1 \dots 10 symbols.
# In a file robosame.py, implement the function create_rules that returns the rule set in the same form 
# as in the preceding task.
# The rule set should satisfy the same requirements as in the preceding task.
